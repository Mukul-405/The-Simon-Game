# The-Simon-Game

This is a web-based implementation of the classic Simon Game. The game displays a series of colored buttons in a random order, and the player must repeat the sequence in the correct order. With each successful repetition, the sequence gets longer, making the game progressively harder

A live demo of the Simon Game is available at: GitHub Pages Link (add your link here)
